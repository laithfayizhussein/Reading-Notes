# Chapter 1- Structure
Html use tags like opening tags and end tags
> <head> appears at the top of search engines only and does not appear on the page

> <body>In this part, all its contents appear on the page, which can be viewed by the user and may contain several tags of it

The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information

## Chapter 8- Extra markup
DOCTYPEs
because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.

Comments in HTML
comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.

Syntax
<!-- comment goes here -->

*ID Attribute*
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).

> It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

*Class attribute
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.*

*Block Elements*
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.

> Examples of block elements are<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
Inline Elements
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.

Examples of inline elements are <a> <b> <em> <img>
Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
block-elements.html HTML The <div>element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element It is used to either:

Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text

Contain a number of inline Elements The most common reason why people use <span> elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS. You will usually see that a class or id attribute is used with <span> elements:

**To explain the purpose of this <span> element**

So that CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes.

IFrames
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

Syntax

<iframe>

> Information About Your Pages
The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page. 

It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire.)

The <meta> element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.
