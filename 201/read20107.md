# Read: 07 - HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
>HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns

**Define an HTML Table**
- The <---table---> tag defines an HTML table.

- Each table row is defined with a <-tr-> tag. Each table header is defined with a <-th-> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <-td-> tag.

- By default, the text in <-th-> elements are bold and centered.

- By default, the text in <-td-> elements are regular and left-aligned.

***function,method,object***
**Functions**
Self-contained bits of JS code that allow us to
- Organize code

- Reuse the same code any number of times, from different
parts of the script

>JS supports several types of function. Commonly used types are:
- Named function declaration

- Anonymous functions

***Objects***
- JavaScript is an object-based language
- It supports for object-oriented programming but not at the same level as
other languages (ES6: introduced class – still lacks private property)
- Objects are represented as property-value pair
- The property values can be data or functions (methods)
- A property is something that can be modified :
- Data properties : primitive values or references to objects
 - Method properties : can be executed
 - Objects can be created and their properties can be changed
dynamically
- JS is not really typed .. If it doesn’t care between a number and a string, why
care between two kinds of objects?
