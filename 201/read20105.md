# Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

**Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.**

**HTML Images Syntax**
- The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

- Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

- The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

- The <img> tag has two required attributes:

*src - Specifies the path to the image*
>the required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

*alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image*
>if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
