# HTML5 STORAGE
From your JavaScript code, youâ€™ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. Before you can use it, you shouldcheck for HTML5 Storage using ...

>function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false; }}
Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
}*else*{
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}

>**HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs.**
 *You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.*

 - *Calling setItem() with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling getItem() with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception.*

- *Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets.*
