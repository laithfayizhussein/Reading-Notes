## i will talk a lot about this pretty languge for me i really like to design the web with it this languge as the color on the panting its help the html to look good and support it .


# why using css with html
## in html if u wanna add color or design for some elemint u sould add one by one but if u have 1000 paragraph and u have css its just need on tage called style and u will make the 1000 para in the same treatment and theres a lot of style that not exiting in the html just in the supporting languge like css and theres goood side for the huge website when u write every single code in the html and u have a lot to design it ,it will take more time than using css.


## hows the css work 
1. ## Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
2. ## Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
3. ## External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
