# text editor
## the text editor is a software that allows you to edit and control text , there are alot of text editors but in the end they are all the same it depends on the user and what he/she prefer , but if u write in the google what the best the reselt will be notebad++ and the defferent between text editors and the ide is that the ide is fully environment where you cant edit and control and compile and debug.

# command line
## the command line (terminal) is an interface to the system based on text there are no gui in it , every system has it's way to open a terminal , we use terminal by typing a command then a command line arguments , and the part of the operating system which defines how the terminal will behave and excuting comands is called shell , you can use echo command to know which shell you are using.

## paths in terminal have two types :
1. ## absolute which specify the location in relation to root directory.
2. ## realtive which specify the location in relation to were we are.

## here are some commands (pwd : to know where are we  , ls : to see the content of the directory , cd : to change directory.)

## linux system handles everything as a file , linux ignore the extension of the file instead it looks inside the file to know it's type so its meaningless to change an extension of a file, linux is also a case sensitive so you have to pay attention to uppercase and lowercase letter .
