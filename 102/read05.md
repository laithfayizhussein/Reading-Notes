# loops
**Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. **
*There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.*

- **for statement** *repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.*
>Syntax:-  for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]){statement}

- A **while** *statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true*
>Syntax:- while (condition) {statement}
