# Read-03: Passing Functions as Props

***


# React Docs - *(lists and keys)*



- ## What does .map() return?

*The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.*


- ## If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

build collections of element then include them in `JSX using {} curly beaces` 
```const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```


- ## *Each list item needs a unique _*Key*_.*

 - ## What is the purpose of a key?
*Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity*

# The Spread Operator:-

## What is the spread operator?
>The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

## List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
**1.Copying an array**
>Using the … spread operator is a convenient way to copy an array or combine arrays, and it can even add new items
```const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
```
**2.Concatenating arrays**
>The spread operator can quickly combine two arrays, an operation known as array concatenation:
```const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩```

**3.Using an array as arguments**

>Since the spread operator “spreads” an array into different arguments, any functions that accepts multiple any number of arguments can benefit from use of the spread operator.

```const fruitStand = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const sellFruit = (f1, f2, f3) => { console.log(`Fruits for sale:
${f1}, ${f2}, ${f3}`) }
sellFruit(...fruitStand) // Fruits for sale: 🍏, 🍊, 🍌
fruitStand.pop()
fruitStand.pop()
fruitStand.push('🍉')
fruitStand.push('🍍')
sellFruit(...fruitStand) // Fruits for sale: 🍏, 🍉, 🍍
fruitStand.pop()
fruitStand.pop()
sellFruit(...fruitStand,'🍋') // Fruits for sale: 🍏, 🍋, undefined 
```
**4.Adding an item to a list**
> the spread operator can add an item to an another array with a natural, easy-to-understand syntax:
```const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

<!-- ## Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

## Add a new item to an array. -->

##  Combine two objects into one.
```const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

# Pass Functions between Components
**In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**
passed the map over the state 

**In your own words, what does the increment function do?**

change the valuue of state and add map to loop over the objects

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

using the class 

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**

passing like any other prop and call the  method
