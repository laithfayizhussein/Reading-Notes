# How I explained REST to my brother

## Who is Roy Fielding?

**He Is a Smart Guy**


## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

**We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.**


## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
**HTTP** is said to be one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing... it is capable of describing the location of something in the world from anywhere in the world.
The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called **REST**. **REST** provides a definition of a *resource*, which is what those things point to.
Web pages are a representation of a resource, the **URL** tells the browser where to look for the resource, and the resource page can sometimes end up with another **URL** that *redirects* us to another resource.
Machines/websites/servers can be in different languages... different nouns... but nouns have verbs, and some verbs are universal across nouns... such as **GET**.
Using the **HTTP** protocol, the browser **GETs** the images of a website that are hosted somewhere else, for instance.
**HTTP** is not just for **GETting**, it is a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
The vision is that it can be used to **GET** or **PUT** or **PATCH** nouns such as *students* and *grades* and *classes* but on a national or international scale, for example...
This is what engineers are working on using **RESTful** web frameworks like **Ruby on Rails**

## What does a **GET** do?

**Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP `GET`.**

## What does a **POST** do?
**If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of `POST`**

## What does **PUT** do?
**If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of `PUT`**

## What does **PATCH** do?

**To do a partial update, it'll hopefully use `PATCH`**
