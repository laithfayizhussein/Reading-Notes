## NOSQL vs SQL

|NOSQL| SQL|

| NOSQL  | SQL    |
|-----------|----------|
| - Primarily called non-relational or distributed database | - Primarily called relational databases |       
| - Document based database | - Table based database |
| - Dynamic structure for unstructured data | - Has pre-defined schema  | 
| - Horizontally scalable | - Vertically scalable |
| - Queries are found on a collection of documents (aka Unstructured Query Language) | - Uses SQL: Structured Query Language |


## **Q&A**

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

  - **SQL**DBs are a good fit for complex queries.

2. Give a real world example.

  - [MySQL database](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/07/howto-install-mysql-on-linux/) is a very popular SQL database 

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

  - Heirarchical data storage is great for NoSQL

4. Give a real world example.

  - [MongoDB](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/01/install-mongodb/) is a very popular NoSQL database

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

  - NoSQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

  - SQL is good for vertically scaling (better hardware), whereas NoSQL is good for horizontally scaling (more servers, or processing power)


## Q&A's on [SQL & NOSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y) 

1. What does SQL stand for?

  - Structured Query Language

2. What is a realational database?

  - Multiple tables which can be identified with similar IDs

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
 
 - Data tables

4. What is a ‘schema’?

  - The structure or blueprint of how data is organized

5. What is a NoSQL database?

  - Non-relational database

6. How does it work?

  - There are collections, which house documents. This is like a nested object within another object

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

  - Collections - the idea behind here is all the data you need is in one place

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

  - If you have a lot of data and update that data a lot, you might want to go with SQL. But if you have a lot of different data, you might want to go with NoSQL.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
 
 - You have to update each collection every time a piece of data changes
