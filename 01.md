## HTML, Structure:
### HTML pages are text documents.

- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs.
- The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content;
- the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.


## HTML, Extra Markup:
### DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using. You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers. The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements. The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

### <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed. The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page. Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©. The two images below shows some markups:


## Process & Design

### It’s important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

### Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

### Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

### Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

### You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

### You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

## JavaScript:
### what is a script and how do I create one?

### A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.


## how use the js in the web

### It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.

### The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
### If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
