# Trees 🌳🌲🎄


- A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

- Terminology :

    - Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes

    - Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.

    - K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

    - Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

    - Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

    - Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

    - Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

    - Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## sample tree
- Traversals

- search for a node, print out the contents of a tree ; categories:

    - Depth First
    - Breadth First

- Depth First

- where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. ways :

    - Pre-order: root >> left >> right

    - pseudocode:
    - ALGORITHM preOrder(root) OUTPUT <-- root.value if root.left is not NULL preOrder(root.left) if root right is not NULL preOrder(root.right)

    - In-order: left >> root >> right
    - ALGORITHM inOrder(root) // INPUT <-- root node // OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values if root.left is not NULL inOrder(root.left) OUTPUT <-- root.value if root.right is not NULL inOrder(root.right)

    - Post-order: left >> right >> root

- ALGORITHM postOrder(root) // INPUT <-- root node // OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values if root.left is not NULL postOrder(root.left) if root.right is not NULL postOrder(root.right) OUTPUT <-- root.value
## Breadth First

- going through each level of the tree node-by-node. So, given our starting tree one more time

## pseudocode:
``` ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root) 
 INPUT <-- root node 
 OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console Queue breadth <-- new Queue() breadth.enqueue(root) while breadth.peek() node front = breadth.dequeue() OUTPUT <-- front.value if front.left is not NULL breadth.enqueue(front.left) if front.right is not NULL breadth.enqueue(front.right)
 ```
 

## K-ary Trees

- If Nodes are able to have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree, we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have. Breadth-First Traversal Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth-first traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down a list of children of length k, instead of checking for the presence of a left and a right child. Pseudocode This process is very similar to our binary tree traversal, but now we check a list of children instead of left and right child properties.

## Binary Trees

In all of our examples, we’ve been using a Binary Tree. Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here is what a binary tree looks like:

## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

Here is how we would change our Binary Tree example into a Binary Search Tree:


## Adding a node

- Because there are no structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go” in a binary tree, it really doesn’t matter where a new node gets placed. One strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down. To do so, we would leverage the use of breadth-first traversal. During the traversal, we find the first node that does not have all its children filled and insert the new node as a child. We fill the child slots from left to right. In the event you would like to have a node placed in a specific location, you need to reference both the new node to create and the parent node upon which the child is attached to.

## Big O

- The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.
