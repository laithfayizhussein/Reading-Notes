# Python Scope

## In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope

## globals

* globals() is a built-in function that returns a reference to the current global scope or namespace dictionary.
* call globals() in a given module, then you’ll get a dictionary containing all the names that you’ve defined in that module


* Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

* Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.
```
[name for name in globals() if name.startswith('__')]
['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__',..., '__annotations__', '__builtins__']

```

* WE can iterate through it through it using these traditional methods:
1. .keys()
1. .values()
1. .items()


## locals   
This function updates and returns a dictionary that holds a copy of the current state of the local Python scope or namespace.
```
def func(arg):
    var = 100
    print(locals())
    another = 200
```
Call the function : `func(300)`
```
{'var': 100, 'arg': 300}
```
## summery :

1. Take advantage of Python scope to avoid or minimize bugs related to name collsion 
2. Make good use of global and local names across your programs to improve code maintainability
3. Use a coherent strategy to access, modify, or update names across all your Python code
