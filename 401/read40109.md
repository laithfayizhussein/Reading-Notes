# Dunder Methods
* In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “**magic methods**.”
inhert or passing the value to another function and make ur life easer 


* Normal code:

```
class NoLenSupport:
    pass

>>> obj = NoLenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
```
`TypeError: "object of type 'NoLenSupport' has no len()"`


* With dunder methods:

```
lass LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
```

`>>> len(obj)`
`42`


## Enriching a Simple Account Class
*  some of python language feature :
1. Initialization of new objects
2. Object representation
3. Enable iteration
4. Operator overloading (comparison)
5. Operator overloading (addition)
6. Method invocation
7. Context manager support (with statement)


### Some usful dunder 

1. Object Initialization: __init__

```
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```

2. Object Representation: __str__, __repr__

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)

```

# Statistics - Probability

* What is probability?

“What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest.

## The data and the distribution
The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape.
